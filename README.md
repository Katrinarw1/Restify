# Restify
A social media site for restaurants (learning JavaScript, React, and Django)

This started as a very open ended uni project for a web programming course. We were told to use Django and React, and to create a social media platform for restaurants where users could follow and like restaurants and such. Beyond that we were free to implement it as we wanted and to upload it to github after the course finished. 

I'm continuing to add features to the website.
